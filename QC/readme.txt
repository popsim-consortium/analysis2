Some simple quality control of the DFE methods.

Using a generic contig of X Mb, with a single element that permits a DFE, run
Slim using a given DFE and parameterization and compare the SFS to moments.
There could be some discrepancies due to interference and BGS, but if we keep
the mutation rate reasonable, it shouldn't be that strong of an effect? We'll
see.

To do:

1. DFE of a fixed value

2. Gamma DFE

each with

a. constant population size

b. size changes
   - bottleneck
   - exponential growth
